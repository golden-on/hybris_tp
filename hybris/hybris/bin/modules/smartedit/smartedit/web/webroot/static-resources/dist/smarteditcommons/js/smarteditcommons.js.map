class that makes it possible for SmartEdit users (CMS managers, editors, etc.) to edit components in the SmartEdit interface.\n * The Generic Editor class is used by the {@link genericEditorModule.directive:genericEditor genericEditor} directive.\n * The genericEditor directive makes a call either to a Structure API or, if the Structure API is not available, it reads the data from a local structure to request the information that it needs to build an HTML form.\n * It then requests the component by its type and ID from the Content API. The genericEditor directive populates the form with the data that is has received.\n * The form can now be used to edit the component. The modified data is saved using the Content API if it is provided else it would return the form data itself.\n * <br/><br/>\n * <strong>The structure and the REST structure API</strong>.\n * <br/>\n * The constructor of the {@link genericEditorModule.service:GenericEditor GenericEditor} must be provided with the pattern of a REST Structure API, which must contain the string  \":smarteditComponentType\", or with a local data structure.\n * If the pattern, Structure API, or the local structure is not provided, the Generic Editor will fail. If the Structure API is used, it must return a JSON payload that holds an array within the attributes property.\n * If the actual structure is used, it must return an array. Each entry in the array provides details about a component property to be displayed and edited. The following details are provided for each property:\n *\n * <ul>\n * <li><strong>qualifier:</strong> Name of the property.\n * <li><strong>i18nKey:</strong> Key of the property label to be translated into the requested language.\n * <li><strong>editable:</strong> Boolean that indicates if a property is editable or not. The default value is true.\n * <li><strong>localized:</strong> Boolean that indicates if a property is localized or not. The default value is false.\n * <li><strong>required:</strong> Boolean that indicates if a property is mandatory or not. The default value is false.\n * <li><strong>cmsStructureType:</strong> Value that is used to determine which form widget (property editor) to display for a specified property.\n * The selection is based on an extensible strategy mechanism owned by {@link genericEditorServicesModule.service:editorFieldMappingService editorFieldMappingService}.\n * <li><strong>cmsStructureEnumType:</strong> The qualified name of the Enum class when cmsStructureType is \"Enum\"\n * </li>\n * <ul><br/>\n *\n * <b>Note:</b><br/>\n * The generic editor has a tabset within. This allows it to display complex types in an organized and clear way. By default, all fields are stored\n * in the default tab, and if there is only one tab the header is hidden. The selection and configuration of where each field resides is\n * controlled by the {@link genericEditorServicesModule.service:editorFieldMappingService editorFieldMappingService}. Similarly, the rendering\n * of tabs can be customized with the {@link genericEditorServicesModule.service:genericEditorTabService genericEditorTabService}.\n * <br />\n * <br />\n *\n * There are two options when you use the Structure API. The first option is to use an API resource that returns the structure object.\n * The following is an example of the JSON payload that is returned by the Structure API in this case:\n * <pre>\n * {\n *     attributes: [{\n *         cmsStructureType: \"ShortString\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier1\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier1',\n *         localized: false\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"LongString\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier2\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier2',\n *         localized: false\n *    }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"RichText\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier3\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier3',\n *         localized: true,\n *         required: true\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"Boolean\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier4\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier4',\n *         localized: false\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"DateTime\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier5\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier5',\n *         localized: false\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"Media\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier6\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier6',\n *         localized: true,\n *         required: true\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"Enum\",\n *         cmsStructureEnumType:'de.mypackage.Orientation'\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier7\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier7',\n *         localized: true,\n *         required: true\n *     }]\n * }\n * </pre><br/>\n * The second option is to use an API resource that returns a list of structures. In this case, the generic editor will select the first element from the list and use it to display its attributes.\n * The generic editor expects the structures to be in one of the two fields below.\n * <pre>\n * {\n *     structures: [{}, {}]\n * }\n *\n * or\n *\n * {\n *     componentTypes: [{}, {}]\n * }\n * </pre>\n * If the list has more than one element, the Generic Editor will throw an exception, otherwise it will get the first element on the list.\n * The following is an example of the JSON payload that is returned by the Structure API in this case:\n * <pre>\n * {\n *     structures: [\n *         {\n *             attributes: [{\n *                 \t\tcmsStructureType: \"ShortString\",\n *                 \t\tqualifier: \"someQualifier1\",\n *                 \t\ti18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier1',\n *                 \t\tlocalized: false\n *             \t\t}, {\n *                 \t\tcmsStructureType: \"LongString\",\n *                 \t\tqualifier: \"someQualifier2\",\n *                 \t\ti18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier2',\n *                 \t\tlocalized: false\n *         \t   \t\t}]\n *         }\n *     ]\n * }\n * </pre>\n * <pre>\n * {\n *     componentTypes: [\n *         {\n *             attributes: [{\n *                 \t\tcmsStructureType: \"ShortString\",\n *                 \t\tqualifier: \"someQualifier1\",\n *                 \t\ti18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier1',\n *                 \t\tlocalized: false\n *             \t\t}, {\n *                 \t\tcmsStructureType: \"LongString\",\n *                 \t\tqualifier: \"someQualifier2\",\n *                 \t\ti18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier2',\n *                 \t\tlocalized: false\n *         \t   \t\t}]\n *         }\n *     ]\n * }\n * </pre>\n * The following is an example of the expected format of a structure:\n * <pre>\n *    [{\n *         cmsStructureType: \"ShortString\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier1\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier1',\n *         localized: false\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"LongString\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier2\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier2',\n *         editable: false,\n *         localized: false\n *    }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"RichText\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier3\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier3',\n *         localized: true,\n *         required: true\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"Boolean\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier4\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier4',\n *         localized: false\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"DateTime\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier5\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier5',\n *         editable: false,\n *         localized: false\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"Media\",\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier6\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier6',\n *         localized: true,\n *         required: true\n *     }, {\n *         cmsStructureType: \"Enum\",\n *         cmsStructureEnumType:'de.mypackage.Orientation'\n *         qualifier: \"someQualifier7\",\n *         i18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier7',\n *         localized: true,\n *         required: true\n *     }]\n * </pre>\n *\n * <strong>The REST CRUD API</strong>, is given to the constructor of {@link genericEditorModule.service:GenericEditor GenericEditor}.\n * The CRUD API must support GET and PUT of JSON payloads.\n * The PUT method must return the updated payload in its response.

The information returned for each validation message is as follows:\n * <ul>\n * \t<li><strong>subject:</strong> The qualifier that has the error</li>\n * \t<li><strong>message:</strong> The error message to be displayed</li>\n * \t<li><strong>type:</strong> The type of message returned. This is of the type ValidationError or Warning.</li>\n * \t<li><strong>language:</strong> The language the error needs to be associated with. If no language property is provided, a match with regular expression /(Language: \\[)[a-z]{2}\\]/g is attempted from the message property. As a fallback, it implies that the field is not localized.</li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * The following code is an example of an error response object:\n * <pre>\n * {\n *    errors: [{\n *        subject: 'qualifier1',\n *        message: 'error message for qualifier',\n *        type: 'ValidationError'\n *    }, {\n *        subject: 'qualifier2',\n *        message: 'error message for qualifier2 language: [fr]',\n *        type: 'ValidationError'\n *    }, {\n *        subject: 'qualifier3',\n *        message: 'error message for qualifier2',\n *        type: 'ValidationError'\n *    }, {\n *        subject: 'qualifier4',\n *        message: 'warning message for qualifier4',\n *        type: 'Warning'\n *    }]\n * }\n *\n * </pre>\n *\n * Whenever any sort of dropdown is used in one of the cmsStructureType widgets, it is advised using {@link genericEditorModule.service:GenericEditor#methods_refreshOptions refreshOptions method}.

'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier1',\n * \t\tidAttribute: \"id\",\n * \t\tlabelAttributes: [\"label\"],\n * \t\tpaged: false,\n * \t\toptions: [{\n *      \tid: '1',\n *      \tlabel: 'option1'\n *      \t}, {\n *      \tid: '2',\n *      \tlabel: 'option2'\n *      \t}, {\n *      \tid: '3',\n *      \tlabel: 'option3'\n *      }],\n * }, {\n * \t\tcmsStructureType: \"EditableDropdown\",\n * \t\tqualifier: \"someQualifier2\",\n * \t\ti18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier2',\n * \t\tidAttribute: \"id\",\n * \t\tlabelAttributes: [\"label\"],\n * \t\tpaged: false,\n * \t\turi: '/someuri',\n * \t\tdependsOn: 'someQualifier1'\n * }, {\n * \t\tcmsStructureType: \"EditableDropdown\",\n * \t\tqualifier: \"someQualifier2\",\n * \t\ti18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier2',\n * \t\tidAttribute: \"id\",\n * \t\tlabelAttributes: [\"label\"],\n * \t\tpaged: false,\n * }, {\n * \t\tcmsStructureType: \"EditableDropdown\",\n * \t\tqualifier: \"someQualifier3\",\n * \t\ti18nKey: 'i18nkeyForsomeQualifier3',\n * \t\tidAttribute: \"id\",\n * \t\tlabelAttributes: [\"label\"],\n * \t\tpaged: false,\n * \t\tpropertyType: 'somePropertyType',\n * }\n * ...\n * ]\n * </pre>\n *\n * <br/>If uri, options and propertyType are not set, then seDropdown will look for an implementation of {@link dropdownPopulatorModule.DropdownPopulatorInterface DropdownPopulatorInterface} with the following AngularJS recipe name:\n * <pre>smarteditComponentType + qualifier + \"DropdownPopulator\"</pre>\n * and default to:\n * <pre>smarteditComponentType + \"DropdownPopulator\"</pre>\n * If no custom populator can be found, an exception will be raised.\n * <br/><br/>For the above example, since someQualifier2 will depend on someQualifier1, then if someQualifier1 is changed, then the list of options\n * for someQualifier2 is populated by calling the populate method of {@link dropdownPopulatorModule.service:uriDropdownPopulator uriDropdownPopulator}.\n *\n * @param {= Object} field The field description of the field being edited as defined by the structure API described in {@link genericEditorModule.service:GenericEditor genericEditor}.\n * @param {Array =} field.options An array of options to be populated.\n * @param {String =} field.uri The uri to fetch the list of options from a REST call, especially if the dropdown is dependent on another one.\n * @param {String =} field.propertyType If a propertyType is defined, the seDropdown will use the populator associated to it with the following AngularJS recipe name : <pre>propertyType + \"DropdownPopulator\"</pre>.\n * @param {String =} field.dependsOn The qualifier of the parent dropdown that this dropdown depends on.\n * @param {String =} field.idAttribute The name of the id attribute to use when populating dropdown items.\n * @param {Array =} field.labelAttributes An array of attributes to use when determining the label for each item in the dropdown\n * @param {Boolean =} field.paged A boolean to determine if we are in paged mode as opposed to retrieving all items at once.\n * @param {= String} qualifier If the field is not localized, this is the actual field.qualifier, if it is localized, it is the language identifier such as en, de...\n * @param {= Object} model If the field is not localized, this is the actual full parent model object, if it is localized, it is the language map: model[field.qualifier].\n * @param {= String} id An identifier of the generated DOM element.\n * @param {< String =} itemTemplateUrl the path to the template that will be used to display items in both the dropdown menu and the selection.\n * @param {& Function =} getApi Exposes the seDropdown's api object\n */\nvar SeDropdownComponent = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function

When the genericEditor directive is about to display a field, it queries the\n * editorFieldMappingService service to retrieve the right strategies to use. Internally, this service makes this selection based on three\n * matchers:\n * <ul>\n * \t<li><b>structureTypeNameMatcher</b>:\tThe matcher for the cmsStructureType of a field.</li>\n * \t<li><b>componentTypeNameMatcher</b>:\tThe matcher for the smarteditComponentType of the CMS component containing the field.</li>\n * <li><b>discriminatorMatcher</b>:\t\t\tThe matcher for the qualifier used by the genericEditor to identify the field.</li>\n * </ul>\n * These three matchers are used together to provide finer-grained control on the selection of strategies.

Measured in multiples of the container height; for example, if the container is 1000 pixels tall and distance is set to 2, the infinite scroll expression will be evaluated when the bottom of the element is within 2000 pixels of the bottom of the container. Defaults to 0 (e.g. the expression will be evaluated when the bottom of the element crosses the bottom of the container).\n * @param {Object} context The container object to which the items of the fetched {@link Page.object:Page Page} will be added\n * @param {Function} fetchPage function to fetch the next page when the bottom of the element approaches the bottom of the container.\n *        fetchPage will be invoked with 3 arguments : <b>mask, pageSize, currentPage</b>. The currentPage is determined by the scrolling and starts with 0. The function must return a page of type {@link Page.object:Page Page}.\n * @param {String} dropDownContainerClass An optional CSS class to be added to the container of the dropdown. It would typically be used to override the default height. <b>The resolved CSS must set a height (or max-height) and overflow-y:scroll.</b>\n * @param {String} dropDownClass An optional CSS class to be added to the dropdown. <b>Neither height nor overflow should be set on the dropdown, it must be free to fill up the space and reach the container size. Failure to do so will cause the directive to call nextPage as many times as the number of available pages on the server.</b>\n */\nvar YInfiniteScrollingComponent = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function YInfiniteScrollingComponent($timeout, encode, lodash, discardablePromiseUtils, $element, generateIdentifier, throttle, testModeService) {\n        this.$timeout = $timeout;\n        this.encode = encode;\n        this.lodash = lodash;\n        this.discardablePromiseUtils = discardablePromiseUtils;\n        this.$element = $element;\n        /** @internal */\n        this.CONTAINER_CLASS = \"ySEInfiniteScrolling-container\";\n        /** @internal */\n        this.initiated = false;\n        this.THROTTLE_MILLISECONDS = 250;\n        this.containerId = generateIdentifier();\n        // needs to be bound for usage by underlying infinite-scroll\n        this.nextPage = this.nextPage.bind(this);\n        if (!testModeService.isE2EMode()) {\n            this.$onChanges = throttle(this.$onChanges.bind(this), this.THROTTLE_MILLISECONDS);\n        }\n    }\n    /** @internal */\n    YInfiniteScrollingComponent.prototype.$onChanges = function () {\n        this.context = this.context || this;\n        this.$postLink();\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    YInfiniteScrollingComponent.prototype.nextPage = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        if (this.pagingDisabled) {\n            return;\n        }\n        this.pagingDisabled = true;\n        this.currentPage++;\n        this.mask = this.mask || \"\";\n        this.discardablePromiseUtils.apply(this.containerId, this.fetchPage(this.mask, this.pageSize, this.currentPage), function (page) {\n            page.results = page.results || [];\n            page.results.forEach(function (element) {\n                element.technicalUniqueId = _this.encode(element);\n            });\n            var uniqueResults = _this.lodash.differenceBy(page.results, _this.context.items, \"technicalUniqueId\");\n            if (_this.lodash.size(uniqueResults) > 0) {\n                Array.prototype.push.apply(_this.context.items, uniqueResults);\n            }\n            /*\n             * pagingDisabled controls the disablement of the native infinite-scroll directive therefore its\n             * re-evaluation must happen on the next digest cycle, after the HTML real estate has been modified\n             * by the new data set.

You can overwrite and update the default configuration.\n *\n * To update the configuration of a specific slider panel, you must instantiate a JSON object that contains the expected\n * configuration in the Angular controller and provide it to the slider panel controller using the HTML template, for example:\n *\n * <pre>\n <y-slider-panel ... data-slider-panel-configuration=\"$ctrl.sliderPanelConfiguration\">\n * </pre>\n *\n * If you define this type of configuration set, SmartEdit will automatically merge it with the slider panel's default configuration.\n * For information about the available settings, see the {@link sliderPanelServiceModule.service:sliderPanelService#methods_getNewServiceInstance getNewServiceInstance} method.\n */\nangular.module('sliderPanelModule', [\n        'ngAnimate',\n        'sliderPanelServiceModule',\n        'yjqueryModule',\n        'yLoDashModule'\n    ])\n\n    /**\n     * @ngdoc object\n     * @name sliderPanelModule.object:CSS_CLASSNAMES\n     * @description\n     * This object defines injectable Angular constants that store the CSS class names used in the controller to define the\n     * rendering and animation of the slider panel.\n     */\n    .constant(\"CSS_CLASSNAMES\", {\n\n        /**\n         * @ngdoc property\n         * @name SLIDERPANEL_ANIMATED {String}\n         * @propertyOf sliderPanelModule.object:CSS_CLASSNAMES\n         *\n         * @description\n         * The class name applied to the slide panel container to trigger the sliding action in the CSS animation.\n         **/\n        SLIDERPANEL_ANIMATED: \"sliderpanel--animated\",\n\n        /**\n         * @ngdoc property\n         * @name SLIDERPANEL_SLIDEPREFIX {String}\n         * @propertyOf sliderPanelModule.object:CSS_CLASSNAMES\n         *\n         * @description\n         * A common prefix for the class names that defines how the content of the slider panel is to be rendered.\n         **/\n        SLIDERPANEL_SLIDEPREFIX: \"sliderpanel--slidefrom\"\n    })\n\n    .controller('sliderPanelController', function(\n        $animate,\n        $element,\n        $scope,\n        $timeout,\n        $window,\n        CSS_CLASSNAMES,\n        yjQuery,\n        lodash,\n        sliderPanelServiceFactory\n    ) {\n\n        var self = this;\n        var sliderPanelService = {};\n\n        var addScreenResizeEventHandler = function() {\n            yjQuery(window).on(\"resize.sliderPanelRedraw_\" + self.uniqueId, function() {\n\n                if (self.isShown) {\n                    $timeout(function() {\n                        sliderPanelService.updateContainerInlineStyling(true);\n                        self.inlineStyling.container = sliderPanelService.inlineStyling.container;\n                    });\n                }\n            });\n        };\n\n        this.isSaveDisabled = function() {\n            if (this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.save &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.save.isDisabledFn) {\n                return this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.save.isDisabledFn();\n            }\n            return false;\n        }.bind(this);\n\n        this.$onInit = function() {\n\n            this.isShown = false;\n            this.uniqueId = lodash.uniqueId();\n\n            // setting new instance of slider panel service\n            sliderPanelService = sliderPanelServiceFactory.getNewServiceInstance($element, $window, this.sliderPanelConfiguration);\n\n            // variables made available on the html template\n            this.sliderPanelConfiguration = sliderPanelService.sliderPanelConfiguration;\n\n            this.slideClassName = CSS_CLASSNAMES.SLIDERPANEL_SLIDEPREFIX + this.sliderPanelConfiguration.slideFrom;\n            this.inlineStyling = {\n                container: sliderPanelService.inlineStyling.container,\n                content: sliderPanelService.inlineStyling.content\n            };\n            this.sliderPanelShow = this.showSlider;\n            this.sliderPanelHide = this.hideSlider;\n\n            this.sliderPanelDismissAction = this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.dismiss &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.dismiss.onClick ?

You can also customize the rendering of your collapsible container in your controller.\n *\n * - ### Angular Module\n *\n * You must add the yCollapsibleContainerModule as a dependency to your Angular module.\n *\n * <pre>\n angular.module('yourApp', ['yCollapsibleContainerModule']) { ... }\n * </pre>\n *\n * - ### HTML template\n *\n * To include HTML content in the collapsible panel, you must embed it within a `<y-collapsible-container> </y-collapsible-container>` tag.<br />\n *\n * <pre>\n <y-collapsible-container>\n    <header>\n        Your title here\n    </header>\n    <content>\n        Your content here\n    </content>\n </y-collapsible-container>\n * </pre>\n *\n * - ### Angular Controller\n *\n * Within your Angular controller, you can define configurations which will get applied on the collapsible container.\n * <pre>\n angular.module('yourApp', ['sliderPanelModule'])\n .controller('yourController', function() {\n     ...\n     this.configuration = { ... };\n

The genericEditor directive populates the form with the data that is has received.\r\n * The form can now be used to edit the component. The modified data is saved using the Content API if it is provided else it would return the form data itself.\r\n * <br/><br/>\r\n * <strong>The structure and the REST structure API</strong>.\r\n * <br/>\r\n * The constructor of the {@link genericEditorModule.service:GenericEditor GenericEditor} must be provided with the pattern of a REST Structure API, which must contain the string  \":smarteditComponentType\", or with a local data structure.\r\n * If the pattern, Structure API, or the local structure is not provided, the Generic Editor will fail. If the Structure API is used, it must return a JSON payload that holds an array within the attributes property.\r\n * If the actual structure is used, it must return an array. Each entry in the array provides details about a component property to be displayed and edited. The following details are provided for each property:\r\n *\r\n * <ul>\r\n * <li><strong>qualifier:</strong> Name of the property.\r\n * <li><strong>i18nKey:</strong> Key of the property label to be translated into the requested language.\r\n * <li><strong>editable:</strong> Boolean that indicates if a property is editable or not. The default value is true.\r\n * <li><strong>localized:</strong> Boolean that indicates if a property is localized or not. The default value is false.\r\n * <li><strong>required:</strong> Boolean that indicates if a property is mandatory or not. The default value is false.\r\n * <li><strong>cmsStructureType:</strong> Value that is used to determine which form widget (property editor) to display for a specified property.\r\n * The selection is based on an extensible strategy mechanism owned by {@link genericEditorServicesModule.service:editorFieldMappingService editorFieldMappingService}.\r\n * <li><strong>cmsStructureEnumType:</strong> The qualified name of the Enum class when cmsStructureType is \"Enum\"\r\n * </li>\r\n * <ul><br/>\r\n *\r\n * <b>Note:</b><br/>\r\n * The generic editor has a tabset within. This allows it to display complex types in an organized and clear way. By default, all fields are stored\r\n * in the default tab, and if there is only one tab the header is hidden. The selection and configuration of where each field resides is\r\n * controlled by the {@link genericEditorServicesModule.service:editorFieldMappingService editorFieldMappingService}.

raised.\r\n * <br/><br/>For the above example, since someQualifier2 will depend on someQualifier1, then if someQualifier1 is changed, then the list of options\r\n * for someQualifier2 is populated by calling the populate method of {@link dropdownPopulatorModule.service:uriDropdownPopulator uriDropdownPopulator}.\r\n *\r\n * @param {= Object} field The field description of the field being edited as defined by the structure API described in {@link genericEditorModule.service:GenericEditor genericEditor}.\r\n * @param {Array =} field.options An array of options to be populated.\r\n * @param {String =} field.uri The uri to fetch the list of options from a REST call, especially if the dropdown is dependent on another one.\r\n * @param {String =} field.propertyType If a propertyType is defined, the seDropdown will use the populator associated to it with the following AngularJS recipe name : <pre>propertyType + \"DropdownPopulator\"</pre>.\r\n * @param {String =} field.dependsOn The qualifier of the parent dropdown that this dropdown depends on.\r\n * @param {String =} field.idAttribute The name of the id attribute to use when populating dropdown items.\r\n * @param {Array =}

You can overwrite and update the default configuration.\n *\n * To update the configuration of a specific slider panel, you must instantiate a JSON object that contains the expected\n * configuration in the Angular controller and provide it to the slider panel controller using the HTML template, for example:\n *\n * <pre>\n <y-slider-panel ... data-slider-panel-configuration=\"$ctrl.sliderPanelConfiguration\">\n * </pre>\n *\n * If you define this type of configuration set, SmartEdit will automatically merge it with the slider panel's default configuration.\n * For information about the available settings, see the {@link sliderPanelServiceModule.service:sliderPanelService#methods_getNewServiceInstance getNewServiceInstance} method.\n */\nangular.module('sliderPanelModule', [\n        'ngAnimate',\n        'sliderPanelServiceModule',\n        'yjqueryModule',\n        'yLoDashModule'\n    ])\n\n    /**\n     * @ngdoc object\n     * @name sliderPanelModule.object:CSS_CLASSNAMES\n     * @description\n     * This object defines injectable Angular constants that store the CSS class names used in the controller to define the\n     * rendering and animation of the slider panel.\n     */\n    .constant(\"CSS_CLASSNAMES\", {\n\n        /**\n         * @ngdoc property\n         * @name SLIDERPANEL_ANIMATED {String}\n         * @propertyOf sliderPanelModule.object:CSS_CLASSNAMES\n         *\n         * @description\n         * The class name applied to the slide panel container to trigger the sliding action in the CSS animation.\n         **/\n        SLIDERPANEL_ANIMATED: \"sliderpanel--animated\",\n\n        /**\n         * @ngdoc property\n         * @name SLIDERPANEL_SLIDEPREFIX {String}\n         * @propertyOf sliderPanelModule.object:CSS_CLASSNAMES\n         *\n         * @description\n         * A common prefix for the class names that defines how the content of the slider panel is to be rendered.\n         **/\n        SLIDERPANEL_SLIDEPREFIX: \"sliderpanel--slidefrom\"\n    })\n\n    .controller('sliderPanelController', function(\n        $animate,\n        $element,\n        $scope,\n        $timeout,\n        $window,\n        CSS_CLASSNAMES,\n        yjQuery,\n        lodash,\n        sliderPanelServiceFactory\n    ) {\n\n        var self = this;\n        var sliderPanelService = {};\n\n        var addScreenResizeEventHandler = function() {\n            yjQuery(window).on(\"resize.sliderPanelRedraw_\" + self.uniqueId, function() {\n\n                if (self.isShown) {\n                    $timeout(function() {\n                        sliderPanelService.updateContainerInlineStyling(true);\n                        self.inlineStyling.container = sliderPanelService.inlineStyling.container;\n                    });\n                }\n            });\n        };\n\n        this.isSaveDisabled = function() {\n            if (this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.save &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.save.isDisabledFn) {\n                return this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.save.isDisabledFn();\n            }\n            return false;\n        }.bind(this);\n\n        this.$onInit = function() {\n\n            this.isShown = false;\n            this.uniqueId = lodash.uniqueId();\n\n            // setting new instance of slider panel service\n            sliderPanelService = sliderPanelServiceFactory.getNewServiceInstance($element, $window, this.sliderPanelConfiguration);\n\n            // variables made available on the html template\n            this.sliderPanelConfiguration = sliderPanelService.sliderPanelConfiguration;\n\n            this.slideClassName = CSS_CLASSNAMES.SLIDERPANEL_SLIDEPREFIX + this.sliderPanelConfiguration.slideFrom;\n            this.inlineStyling = {\n                container: sliderPanelService.inlineStyling.container,\n                content: sliderPanelService.inlineStyling.content\n            };\n            this.sliderPanelShow = this.showSlider;\n            this.sliderPanelHide = this.hideSlider;\n\n            this.sliderPanelDismissAction = this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.dismiss &&\n                this.sliderPanelConfiguration.modal.dismiss.onClick ?
